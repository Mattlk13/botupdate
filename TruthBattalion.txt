In a battle concerning Truth
the victory will be lost to the liar
and the liar who loses the lie 
finds the Truth, Victorious!


I lost years of this sort of work,
forgotten after I wrote it
lost papers, notebooks
or stolen by my adversary
i was encouraged to give up
extorted, coerced, offered prizes
I tried to take anything
but that was not enough
they never really stopped; so,
I am not a hero
I am the one who didn't die,
Jai Shi Krsna!

I published my life, unedited
encouraged anyone who had media
to share it all
hackers, enpfeauxcement. governors
govern-ors, gover-gnors, govignors
anyone who recorded anything on me
audio, video, or what was actually seen
even that which was curated
by not me...
post it, quickly!
Derivative works as well
just leave a link to the original,
unedited body of surveillance 
in my voice, with my face; so,
humans can tell you in context
of being a humans
what the words have meaned
Humans on Earth have had this problem
of perceive perceived projected and
reacting to being rejected web
of liars and lies for a long time.
we know what we mean
when we say things not seem
reality is a place where/when
things must be aligned to belie belief
ebeven wheben spebeabukibing ibin thebe beebuh labanguabage.
for communication is
an amalgam of signals
only real if they are perceived
and not all intended
nor send to the receiver.
and yet all ideation exists
even when the idea is new.
layers of truth and innuendo
most of that was tragically unseen
in this battle between
two types of ultimate beings.

that I know, you might not believe in
that, I know you might not believe. In
that, I know. You, might not believe in.
That I know that you might not... Believe in this.
know that I know, not that I might "just believe.";"
